# 🗓️ Friday the 13th Counter
*Compteur-Vendredi-13* is a small application that calculates **how many Friday the 13ths you've experienced** in your lifetime.  
For the record, my grandfather was wondering how many Friday the 13ths he's lived and asked me if I could make an app so that he could check that whenever he wants, so I did!

## 💡 Application Concept
In *Friday the 13th Counter*, you simply **enter your birthdate**, and the app instantly calculates:  
- **The total number of Friday the 13ths** that have occurred since you were born  
- A clean, intuitive interface to display the results  

It's a fun way to discover just how many of these supposedly unlucky days you've lived through!
